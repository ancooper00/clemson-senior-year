README for CPSC 4200 HW 1

Partners: Ashlyn Cooper and Kateryna Hunicheva 

For this assignment we each initially worked separately before coming
together to discuss either a solution that we found or problems that we were encountering. Kateryna
figured out Problem 2 very quickly. Ashlyn spent a lot of her time working through Problem 1. 
We met once in order to discuss and work through Problem 1 together. Unable to find a solution, Ashlyn went to
office hours and sent a few emails about some of the problems we were having. We then brefiely discussed the 
problem again before Ashlyn figured out a solution to Problem 1. So, it ended up being that Ashlyn did a 
lot fo the grunt work for Problem 1 and then Kateryna did a lot of the grunt work for Problem 2. 

Zipped together here are three files. 
    -len_ext_attack.py that contains the solution for Problem 1
    -good.py and evil.py that contains the solution for Problem 2
