README HW 3 4200

Partners: Ashlyn Cooper and Kateryna Hunicheva 

For this assignment we split the work up by the attacks. Ashlyn worked on and figured out each of the 
SQL injection attacks and she also figured out the first CSRF attack. Kateryna worked on the XSS attacks and
the second CSRF attack. After we each figured out the different attacks, we met and showed each other how 
each attack worked and how we solved the problem.
