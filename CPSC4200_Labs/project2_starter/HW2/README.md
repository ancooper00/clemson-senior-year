# Project 2: Cryptography Part 2

Do not modify pymd5.py or roots.py. We will grade your submission with our own versions of these files.

### Part 1 submission checklist:
* padding\_oracle.py

### Part 2 submission checklist:
* bleichenbacher.py

Partners: Kateryna Hunicheva and Ashlyn Cooper

For this assignment, we split up the problems like we did for the first homework assignment so we could divide and conquer. Kateryna focused on part 2, while Ashlyn started her focus on part 1. Early on Kateryna figured out part 2 and we each met in order to go over how the code/solution worked for part 2. Ashlyn worked on part 1 extensivly and met with Kateryna to discuss how she believed the problem should be solved andd how the attack generally works. Ashlyn encountered much difficulty with the coding implementation of part 1 (both from an alogrithm and python perspective) and shared her progress with Kateryna. Kateryna then worked on debugging and finding the problems in the code, before ultimately trying out the problem from scratch. We then met a final time to discuss how the part 1 code worked once a solution was found. 

For part 1, our program takes several minutes to produce the decrypted message, so please be patient when running. 

In this zipped archive are 3 files:
    - this attached README
    - padding_oracle.py for Part 1
    - bleichenbacher.py for Part 2
